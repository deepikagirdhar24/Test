ICOS API Automation Framework â€“ Key Contributions / Goals

Designed and enhanced a Cucumber + REST-assured-based API automation framework integrated with ExtentReports for rich reporting.

Built POJO-based payload builders for dynamic and reusable API request generation across multiple ICOS services.

Implemented data-driven testing using Cucumber Scenario Outlines and utility methods for random and dynamic data generation.

Automated end-to-end validation for key ICOS APIs like Natural Person, Contact Notes, Document, and Work Request.

Developed dynamic date resolution logic (TOSCA-style) for payload fields such as dueDate.

Created helper utilities for JSON parsing, token management, and response validation.

Refactored framework structure by moving assertions to step definitions, improving clarity and maintainability.

Implemented chained API testing, passing data (e.g., personId) seamlessly between dependent API calls.

Ensured comprehensive validation of response fields, including nested and list structures, against input payloads.

Improved overall framework scalability and reusability, setting the foundation for future ICOS API coverage.
