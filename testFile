The objective is to automate the Smart Advice process using UIPath to eliminate manual steps and improve process accuracy. The automation will involve designing end-to-end workflows leveraging UIPath components such as Orchestrator, queues, triggers, and data scraping activities. It will extract and validate input data from multiple sources (like Excel, web applications, or APIs), perform rule-based logic, and generate Smart Advice outputs automatically. The focus will be on building a robust, reusable, and scalable automation solution integrated with existing business processes to enhance efficiency, reduce turnaround time, and ensure consistency in delivery.
