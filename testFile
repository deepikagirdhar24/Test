With a heavy heart, I would like to inform you that I am resigning from my position as Systems Analyst for Alight Solutions, effective today i.e. 9th May 2018 . As required by my employment contract, I will be serving 60 days notice, effective today and my last day at work will be 6th July 2018. Thank you for the opportunities for professional and personal development that you have provided me during these years. I have enjoyed working for this organization and appreciate the support provided to me during my tenure with the company.

 

If I can be of any help during this phase, please let me know.
