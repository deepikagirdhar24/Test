  Scenario Outline: Verify the Post Contact Notes API with valid inputs
    Given Send Request to get Authentication Token for ICOS
    When I generate the JWT Token
    And Send request to generate New Person with below details
      | firstName       | <firstName>    |
      | lastName        | Lastname       |
      | subType         | pers_form_ass  |
      | domicileCountry | CH             |
      | gender          | male           |

      | notes        | <notes>       |
      | hasFollowup  | <hasFollowup> |
    And I verify the Status Code for Contact Notes "<statusCode>"

      | FirstName_1 | RANDOM_EXACT_250 | Testnote  | false       | 200        | Subject equal to 250 chars  |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      |           | false       | 200        | Notes as Empty String       |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      | Testnote  | true        | 200        | hasFollowup as 'Yes'        |
