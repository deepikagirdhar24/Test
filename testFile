Feature: Create Contact Notes API

  Scenario Outline: Verify the Post Contact Notes API
    Given Send Request to get Authentication Token for ICOS
    When I generate the JWT Token
    And Send request to generate New Person with below details
      | firstName       | <firstName>    |
      | lastName        | Lastname       |
      | subType         | pers_form_ass  |
      | domicileCountry | CH             |
      | gender          | male           |
      | nationality     | CH             |
    Then Send POST ContactNote Request with below details
      | subject      | <subject>     |
      | notes        | <notes>       |
      | hasFollowup  | <hasFollowup> |
    And I verify the Status Code for Contact Notes "<statusCode>"
    And I verify the OrderId

    Examples:
      | firstName   | subject          | notes     | hasFollowup | statusCode |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      | Testnote  | false       | 200        | 
      | FirstName_2 | Testsubject      | Testnote  | false       | 200        |
      | FirstName_1 | RANDOM_LESS_250  | Testnote  | false       | 200        |
      | FirstName_1 | RANDOM_EXACT_250 | Testnote  | false       | 200        |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      |           | false       | 200        |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      | Testnote  | true        | 200        |
      | FirstName_1 | Testsubject      | Testnote  | null        | 200        |
