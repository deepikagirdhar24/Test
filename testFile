Scenario: Verify the Get Prospect API
  Given Send Request to get Authentication Token for ICOS
  When I generate the JWT Token
  And I save the generated Prospect ID as "PROSPECT_ID"
  Then Send request to get Prospect Information
    | prospectId | PROSPECT_ID |
    | type       | sole        |
  And I verify the Status Code for Get Prospect "200"
